# Halloween Word Guess

Halloween word guess is a fun and festive CLI application. The node inquirer package is used to prompt the user to guess a letter. The user can enter one letter and get a response as to whether that letter is in the word that is to be guessed. If the user completes the word or runs out of guesses then a new word is provided and the game starts over. The words are chosen randomly and are all related to Halloween. 

To play the game the user can download the application and within the folder in the command line type:

* node index.js
